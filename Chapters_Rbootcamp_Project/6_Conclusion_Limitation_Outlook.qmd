# Conclusion, limitations and outlook

## Conclusions

### At the level of content

-   Our **proof of concept** showed potential customers how rich the
    data on Google searches and YouTube videos is. It became clear that
    different brands play in very **different leagues**, regardless of
    their industry. Based on our analyses, we would describe the iPhone
    as a global player, Tesla as an international player, and Rolex as a
    niche player (although with a global/international reach).
-   By comparing YouTube and Google searches, we were able to show that
    use of **YouTube** **videos is much less consistent over time than
    Google searches**. Peaks such as the launch of the iPhone X fade
    relatively quickly on YouTube, while they are less pronounced on
    Google Search but have a much longer lasting effect.
-   We identified **correlations** between different brands and created
    a **linear model** that correlates search behavior in one country
    with behavior in another. Both approaches become even more important
    when examining brands in the same industry or the response to
    multinational advertising campaigns. And we were able to demonstrate
    the **seasonality** of search behavior on Google using the example
    of Rolex. This insight is of **direct benefit** to brand managers,
    as it helps them better manage slumps or extend peaks through
    campaigns.
-   Using YouTube videos, we were able to show that brand managers
    should keep an eye on **user engagement**, both positive in the form
    of likes/views and negative in the form of dislikes/views, and
    compare it with that of their competitors.
-   Finally, the word clouds reminded us that despite all the numbers
    and ratings, **content** should not be forgotten. The numbers for
    Rolex YouTube videos may look good. But is it also in the interest
    of brand managers if the primary focus is on showcasing German
    hip-hop artists?

### At the school level

We implemented many different pieces of content that we learned in the R
bootcamp in a project and also developed **new additional topics**. For
example, we learned how to access current Google search data and how to
analyze the content of YouTube videos using wordclouds. By solving
problems using the usual R tools, Google searches, and AI chat bots, we
have now gained a certain **confidence** that we can master future
challenges.

## Limitations

Many limitations ultimately proved to be solvable problems that we were
able to fix with a little data wrangling, for example. However, some
aspects **fundamentally limited** our evaluations:

-   For YouTube, we worked with a Kaggle dataset **from 2017 to 2018**.
    This was sufficient for our purposes. In addition to this use case,
    which focuses on what can be gained from YouTube data, we would of
    course also like to investigate specific cases. To do this, access
    to current data is essential.
-   A second limitation arose when we attempted to track certain videos
    over a longer period of time to see how long they remained
    available. Apparently, the **cryptic video IDs change** from time to
    time, so we were unable to perform any meaningful analysis in this
    regard.
-   For Google Search, we worked with data that we were able to download
    daily from Google Search Trends. One initial difficulty is that
    **Google restricts downloads** in a rather unpredictable manner.
    This significantly limits the workflow, as all downloads must be
    cached locally for security reasons.
-   However, the bigger problem with Google Search is that **only
    relative numbers** are available. It is not possible to obtain the
    absolute number of searches per keyword. All values are calibrated
    by Google Search Trends to 0-100 for each search query. On the one
    hand, this means **a significant loss of information** and makes it
    **impossible to compare different search queries** with each other.
-   A final limiting factor was our somewhat **theoretical experimental
    setup**. With a more concrete case, our analysis would have been
    much more concise and the overall picture more coherent. The fact
    that we had data from 2017/2018 and were working with such data for
    the first time prompted us to examine somewhat more general
    questions, which we considered appropriate. But let's imagine
    Guiness Beers was our client and we could observe the launch of
    their first **non-alcoholic** Guinness Stout beer! That would, of
    course, give the analysis and the story a whole different dynamic!

## Outlook

The limitations mentioned above lead to the main points we would address
next:

-   It is possible to **load current YouTube data**. However, this
    requires a Google Cloud project and an API key. Even then, there are
    certain limitations, but the data would definitely be more
    comprehensive than the data available to us in the `Kaggle` dataset.
    In this context, we would also look at the `Tuber package` (CRAN),
    which can be used to load data on specific videos. For example, if
    Rolex decides to make its own videos available on YouTube to
    influence their brand image in its favor.
-   We would also try to find a way to obtain **uncalibrated Google
    search data**. However, initial attempts are not promising; Google
    is obviously making this impossible on purpose. The
    `Google Ads Keyword Planner` could be a possibility, though.
-   One small problem concerns the word clouds. It would have been nice
    to create the iPhone word cloud in the **format of the Apple logo**.
    However, even after an intensive search, we were unable to do this.
    We will not give up and will make a few more attempts.

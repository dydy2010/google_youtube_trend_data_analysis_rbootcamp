Hi, this is supposed to be the final report to be submitted, we can start put parts in it already,
whenever we have a section ready.

# Analysis and Visualisation (Dongyuan's part)
## Part 1: The Big Picture - Comparing the Brands
```{r graph1}
# Graph 1: Overall Search Interest Comparison (Line Chart)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = combined_data_final, aes(x = trending_date, y = hits, color = keyword)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Google Search Interest Over Time",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Relative Search Interest (0-100)",
    color = "Keyword"
  )
```

<br>
